# Audio Compressor
Compressor for audio input.

This is a stomp box like Compressor. You can tried it out with a guitar plugged into an iRig adapter. When off, works as a bypass like any effect foot pedal.

Created to experiment with [AudioKit](http://audiokit.io/) API. Based on `AKCompressor`class from [AudioKit](http://audiokit.io/) 1.3.
